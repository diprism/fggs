    Given a permutation of the nodes (called an elimination ordering),
    for each node, remove the node and make its neighbors into a clique.
    The maximum degree of the nodes at the time of their elimination is
    the width of the tree decomposition corresponding to that ordering.
    The treewidth of the graph is the minimum over all possible
    permutations.
