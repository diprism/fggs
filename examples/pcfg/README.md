# PCFG examples

- atis.pcfg is a PCFG trained without smoothing on the ATIS portion of the Penn Treebank. Some simple binarization was applied to ensure that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form. The start symbol is TOP.
- wsj2.pcfg is a PCFG generated by the Berkeley parser for sections 02-21 of the WSJ portion of the Penn Treebank, using 1 split. The start symbol is ROOT_0.

To generate atis.json and wsj2.json:

```
python3 make_pcfg.py atis.pcfg TOP atis.json
python3 make_pcfg.py wsj2.pcfg ROOT_0 wsj2.json
```
